# Neuromorphic Computing for Energy-Efficient AI

Neuromorphic Computing for Energy-Efficient AI is a comparative project that demonstrates how **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** can drastically reduce power consumption compared to traditional **Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs)**, especially on low-power hardware like the Raspberry Pi 3B+. The project features a command-line interface (CLI) Python tool that benchmarks both models in terms of accuracy and energy usage.

## 🌐 Overview

As Artificial Intelligence evolves, its deployment in edge devices and low-power systems poses a significant energy efficiency challenge. Traditional models like FFNNs are computationally intensive and unsuitable for environments like Raspberry Pi-based systems.

**Neuromorphic computing**, inspired by the brain's architecture, introduces **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** that only consume energy during signal spikes—making them ideal for energy-constrained platforms.

This project compares the performance and energy efficiency of FFNNs and SNNs by implementing both on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. The Python CLI application provides metrics on inference accuracy and power consumption.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* 🔍 Compare performance and energy usage of FFNN vs. SNN.
* 🔋 Demonstrate SNNs’ suitability for low-power AI.
* 🌐 Highlight real-world applications in edge computing and IoT.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

As AI systems scale, energy demands rise—especially when used on embedded or edge devices. FFNNs require constant computation, making them power-hungry. In contrast, **SNNs operate asynchronously**, consuming energy only when neurons fire. The project addresses whether SNNs can be a viable solution for low-power applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 📉 **Power Measurement**: Compare energy use of both models on hardware.
* 📈 **Accuracy Benchmarking**: Output accuracy for each model after inference.
* 🧠 **Neuromorphic Design**: Implement SNN using Python libraries like `Brian2`.
* 💻 **Hardware-Ready**: Optimized for Raspberry Pi 3B+.
* 🔧 **CLI Tool**: No GUI, lightweight script execution for benchmarking.
